      What's there to say about me?
      <br />
      By day, I'm a driven, hungry, resilient, curious front-end developer who
      likes to use adjectives.
      <br />
      By night, I'm sadly not Batman. Yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently employed in London by{' '}
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.gamesyscorporate.com/">
        Gamesys
      </ExternalLink>
      , one of the UK leading gaming companies. My main
      focus is the development of a tool called Babble, which is used internally to manage and moderate our community of players.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm obsessed with React and its ecosystem, and I try really hard to keep
      up with all the latest developments in the field.
      <br />
      Out of all the tools I tried, it is by far the one I most enjoy using, and
      I definitely see it sticking around for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have other interests, too! Boardgames, videogames, LEGO and Formula 1 to
      name a few... I also like reading, movies and tv shows, but who doesn't,
      really?
